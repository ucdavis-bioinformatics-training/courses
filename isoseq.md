Iso-Seq
--------

The Bioinformatics Core is excited to announce a three day workshop on Iso-Seq in partnership with PacBio! With instruction from experienced Core personnel and Iso-Seq analysis experts Dr. Liz Tseng, Principal Scientist at PacBio, and Dr. Ana Conesa, Professor at the University of Florida, this short course will provide a mixture of lectures and hands-on analysis to give participants an overview of the possibilities represented by full length transcript isoform sequencing with Iso-Seq.

Participants will explore experimental design, cost estimation, data generation, and analysis, following Iso-Seq experiments from end to end and learning about several applications of this high quality full length RNA sequence data. Exercises will be performed with provided datasets, using command-line interaction on the Genome Center Compute Cluster.

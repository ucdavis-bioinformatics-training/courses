Variant Analysis
------------

This workshop will include a rich collection of lectures and hands-on sessions, covering both theory and tools associated with command-line DNA variant analysis. Participants will explore experimental design, cost estimation, data generation, and analysis of DNA sequence data generated on the Illumina sequencing platform. Participants will explore software and protocols, create and modify workflows, and diagnose/treat problematic data utilizing high performance computing services. Exercises will be performed with provided datasets, using command-line interaction on the Genome Center Compute Cluster, which will be available to you to use for a week after the workshop, so you can continue to practice these skills.

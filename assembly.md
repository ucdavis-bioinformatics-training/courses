Genome Assembly
-----------

Genome Assembly is currently in a renaissance, with new technologies coming together to complement each other, producing high-quality reference grade assemblies. This workshop will focus on project design, library and sequencing technologies, genome assembly and data type integration process, and evaluation in a practical and informative setting.

The format will be approximately half lecture and half hands-on. The hands-on portion of the workshop will involve command-line interaction with some R, therefore prior command-line and R experience is a must to fully participate. If you are not familiar with the command line but would like to attend, listen, and learn that is OK, but we will be unable to train you in how to use the command-line and R during this workshop.

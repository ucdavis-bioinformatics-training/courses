Epigenetics
---------

This workshop will include a rich collection of lectures and hands-on sessions, covering both theory and tools associated with the analysis of data generated by several common types of epigenetic experiments, primarily data from the Illumina platform. Participants will explore experimental design, cost estimation, data generation, and analysis of DNA sequence data. Participants will explore software and protocols, create and modify workflows, and diagnose/treat problematic data utilizing high performance computing services. Exercises will be performed with provided datasets, using command-line interaction on the Genome Center Compute Cluster.

#Introduction to Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis

This workshop will cover experimental design, data generation, data reduction and basic analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data (Example dataset is from the 10x Genomics platform) on the 'command line' and within the R statistical programming environment. Participants will explore software and protocols, create and modify workflows, and diagnose/treat problematic data utilizing high performance computing services and R code. Within this introductory course we will use 10x Genonics software cellranger for data reduction (sequence reads to counts) and R packages (ex. Seurat) for downstream analysis.

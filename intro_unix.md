Introduction to Unix and the Command-Line
--------------

Unix is a command-line-based platform that is a highly powerful and flexible tool for data management and analysis. First, this workshop introduces the basic concepts of UNIX operating system and shell scripting. We will explore essential hands-on skills to confidently use the command line interface on either a local (laptop) or a remote computer running the Unix system. Next, this workshop covers how to navigate around the Unix file system from the command line and use a number of basic, common Unix commands. The course is supplemented with many hands-on examples. No prior knowledge of Unix or programming is required.

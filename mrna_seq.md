#mRNA-ASeq Analysis

This workshop will include a rich collection of lectures and hands-on sessions with individualized instructor support, covering both theory and tools associated with RNA-seq data analysis. Participants will explore experimental design, technology usage, cost estimation, data generation, and analysis (command-line and R) of RNA-Seq data, generated from the Illumina sequencing platform. Participants will use software and protocols, create and modify workflows, and diagnose/treat problematic data utilizing high performance computing services. Exercises will be performed with provided datasets.

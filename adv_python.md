This workshop will cover some more advanced topics in python including an overview of object-oriented python (this will not be an in-depth course on object-oriented programming), use of the numpy and pandas libraries (python libraries for efficient handling of large numeric and heterogenous datasets, and matplotlib for plotting results. At the end of this workshop, students will better understand the python data structures for handling large datasets and will have some knowledge of how to manipulate these data and plot them for presentation.

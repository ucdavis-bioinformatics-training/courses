Advanced Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis
----------------

This workshop will cover advanced topics in experimental design, data generation, and analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data on the command line and within the R statistical programming language. Participants will explore software and protocols, create and modify workflows, and diagnose/treat problematic data utilizing high performance computing services. Exercises will be performed on the command line and within R with a provided dataset.

Participants should be familiar with the material covered in Introduction to Single Cell RNA-Seq Analysis, including the use of the command line and R (see prerequisites section). Prior experience with the command line and R is a must to fully participate. If you would like to attend, listen and learn, that is OK, but we will be undable to train you in how to use the command line and R during this workshop.
